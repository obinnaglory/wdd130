                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Born from a shared love for wild rivers and wild hearts, our rafting journey began over a decade ago with a simple idea: help people reconnect—with nature, with adventure, and with each other. What started as weekend excursions among friends quickly grew into a full-fledged rafting company, driven by passion and a commitment to unforgettable outdoor experiences.
                Nestled near the roaring rapids of [insert region], our founders—avid explorers, nature enthusiasts, and dedicated family adventurers—set out to create more than just trips. They built a culture of safety, respect, and exhilaration. Year after year, we've introduced thousands to the thrill of whitewater rafting, customizing each journey to suit solo thrill-seekers, corporate groups, and multi-generational families alike.
                Through storms, smiles, and splashes, our story has always been guided by the belief that the river teaches us something every time we ride. We’ve grown with the currents—adding new routes, embracing sustainable practices, and building digital tools to make planning easier for adventurers from all walks of life.
                And now, this website marks another chapter—a space where the rush of the river meets the touch of storytelling. We invite you to be a part of this ongoing tale. Let’s ride, reconnect, and remember forever—together.</p>
